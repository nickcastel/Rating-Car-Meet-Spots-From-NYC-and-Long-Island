      <br><p><center> Being a car nerd such as myself, I have always been looking for ways to engage with other car lovers as well as a place to share stories and learn tips! Plus who doesn't love to hangout with other people who share the same hobby as you?
And so I began to reach out into the car community. Starting out small by talking to my friends and getting in touch with their friends who were also into cars as well! From here I was able to get a 
comfortable group of friends with whom I would be able to continue to venture out and explore all the aspects that the car community had to offer. This is how I was able to attend my first car meet,
 a memory that is still strongly embeded in my mind! Eventually my own personal map of Car Meet locations grew to the one you see before you on this very website. What makes this website so special?
 It is full of markers that layout the journey I have taken in becoming a fan of the automotive world. From a new Donut Media subscriber on Youtube back in High School, to a college student constantly
 learning more about what makes automobiles work, what the future holds and all while saving up to buy a new car in the coming years. From going to the International Autoshow in New York City with 
my dad for the first time before I even had my learner's permit, to meeting up with fellow carnerds over at Captree State Park. These map points mean so much to me because they truly are a portion of my memories within this hobby I have developed over the years.</center></p></br>
